>“Today wasn’t about speed. It was about alignment.”

Determined to pass through Neo’s Veil once more, I threw on Ghost in the Wire by Kevin Mitnick today and was dropped straight into the thick of it. I wrapped the session at chapter three, realizing just how little I actually knew about the telecom industry—and how overpowered my knowledge in other industries is, and always has been. It got me thinking that it’s high time I returned to my bread-and-butter and got my ass into a dumpster one of these days.

Back at the home lab, I polished off my OrangePi running a DietPi distro-flavor build for training and experimentation. It’s shaping up to be a promising learning path for the two of me—Me & Më, both myself and I—as we trudge onward through the thick valley of hacker lore and code, forging a new way through this treacherous, abysmal land we call Life.
